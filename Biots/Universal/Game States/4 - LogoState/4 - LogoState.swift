//  ðŸ”¶ STEP 4: This is the initial game state for the OctopusKit QuickStart project.

//  It displays the OKLogoScene which is provided by OctopusKit. When the logo scene finishes its animations, it tells the game coordinator to transition to the next state, which for this project is the TitleState.
